# 🤖 Automated Customer Service Workflow using n8n

This project is a real-time, automated customer support system built with **n8n**, **OpenAI**, **Gmail**, and **Google Sheets**.  
It reads incoming customer emails, understands them using AI, categorizes and logs the messages, and sends back personalized responses — all without human input.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Incoming Emails**  
   Customers send support inquiries (e.g., “My hoodie hasn’t arrived”, “Item arrived damaged”) to the business email address.

2. **Email Filtering**  
   All new emails with the label `N8N-Test` are automatically picked up by the system for processing.

3. **AI-Powered Understanding**  
   Each email is sent to **OpenAI** (GPT) which does three things:
   - Generates a relevant and human-like reply
   - Determines the **category** of the inquiry (e.g., Refund, Exchange, General)
   - Analyzes the **emotional tone** (e.g., calm, happy)

4. **Logging**  
   The system logs every email into a structured **Google Sheet**, including:
   - Timestamp
   - Customer email
   - Original message subject
   - AI-generated reply
   - Detected category
   - Detected tone

5. **Reply Sent Automatically**  
   The reply generated by the AI is sent back to the customer using **Gmail**, closing the loop in a matter of seconds.
